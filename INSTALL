To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``dbtemplates``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout. Since ``dbtemplates`` is registered in the
Python Package Index you can also run ``easy_install django-dbtemplates``
or ``pip django-dbtemplates`` optionally.

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a recent
Subversion checkout of Django. You can obtain Python from
http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.

This install notice was bluntly stolen from James Bennett's registration
package, http://www.bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/
