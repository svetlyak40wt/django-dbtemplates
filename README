Database template loader for Django
===================================

``dbtemplates`` is a Django app that comes with to parts: It allows you to
create templates that are saved in your database, and it provides a so called
`template loader`_, a function that enables Django to find the templates you
created in the database.

It also includes a extensible caching mechanism and supports version control
of the templates saved in the database.

Please see ``docs/overview.txt`` for more details.
